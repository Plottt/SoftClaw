Three_finger_code.ino contains code and instructions to operate the soft robotics hand, including waypoint-based and contact-detection based manipulation. It can be run using the Arduino IDE version 2.3.2. Available for download from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

The finger_characterisation folder contains data from the finger characterization tests (2024_1122_0mm.txt, 2024_1122_10mm.txt, and 2024_1122_20mm.txt), code to run the finger characterize test (1_finger_withloadcell_pwm_test.ino), and a data analysis script (multi_distance_data_interpreter.m). The code to run the finger characterize test can be run using the Arduino IDE version 2.3.2. The data analysis script can be run using Matlab version R2023a.

The CAD folder contains GRIPPER_ASSEM.STEP, a file for the hand assembly. It can be opened using Solidworks version 2023.

Supplemental_Video.mp4 contains a .mp4 video which can be played in QuickTime player (Mac) or Media Player (Windows).
