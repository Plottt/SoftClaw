Three_finger_code.ino contains code and instructions to operate the soft robotics hand, including waypoint-based and contact-detection based manipulation. It can be run using the Arduino IDE version 2.3.2. Available for download from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

finger_characterisation contains data and code to characterize the contact detection and the force-curvature relationship after contact. The script can be run using Matlab version R2023a.

CAD contains a .STEP file for the hand assembly. It can be opened using Solidworks version 2023.

Supplemental_Video.mp4 contains a .mp4 video which can be played in QuickTime player (Mac) or Media Player (Windows).
